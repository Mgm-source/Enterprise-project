I downloaded the JS and CSS libraries only because the internet at the dorm I am staying cuts out sometimes. I Know about cdns and such.
Also because I downloaded the libraries and using them locally for some there is a random "jque" folder that gets created in the js directory "don't know";

I may take out the local libraries when I submit this assignment, if I have forget this.
